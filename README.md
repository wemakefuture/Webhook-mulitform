# What is this boilerplate
This boildeprlate is a fork of [WordPress Boilerplate](https://github.com/DevinVinson/WordPress-Plugin-Boilerplate) but with namespaces, shortcodes support and phpstan support out of the box. 

# How to use

 1. Create a folder inside your wordpress installation and name it after your plugin
 2. Copy a dump of this repo inside the folder
 3. Make sure `setup.sh` is executable (`chmod +x setup.sh`)
 4. Run `setup sh` . The `-f` parameter determines the filename (*snake_case*) for assets while the `-n` parameter sets the namespace and php class filenames (*Pascal_Snake_Case*). If your plugins name should be 'Awesome Plugin' the full command would look like: `./setup.sh -f awesome_plugin -n Awesome_Plugin`.
 5. Thats it. You maybe want to remove `setup.sh` or this `readme.md` file
